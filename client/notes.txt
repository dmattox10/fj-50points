2. Using Launch StoryBoard as a splash screen:
Launch storyboard images: Images are sized based on scale, idiom, and size classes. Supports all devices, and can be used with split-screen/slide-over multitasking.
The launch image needs to meet the following requirements:
the image should be square
the image should be large enough to fit on an iPad Pro 12.9": 2732x2732
anything important should fit within the center
Once the single image of 2732x2732 is created, you can include it in your project by adding the following to the outerconfig.xml:
<splash src="res/screen/ios/Default@2x~universal~anyany.png" />
Place the image in res/screen/ios path with the name Default@2x~universal~anyany.png
Then prepare your cordova/ionic project using the command:
 cordova prepare --nofetch
Open project in Xcode, go to General → Under App icon and Launch Screen set as below:
Set Launch image Sources → Don not use asset Catalog
Set Launch Screen File → CDVLaunchScreen.storyboard

3. Update the Status bar plugin ( cordova-plugin-statusbar)
The status bar plugin has changed for iphoneX , remove the old plugin and add it again.Since the size of the status bar changed on iphone X older version of the plugin will display incorrectly.
4. Update cordova ios platform version to cordova-ios@4.5.4
LaunchScreen storyboard constraints were never updated for ios11/iphoneX. This can cause the splashscreen to jump during startup causing a white patch at bottom initially.
